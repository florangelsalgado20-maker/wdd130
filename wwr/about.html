                <p> Our story begins not with a grand launch, but with a global pause. In 2019, the
                    seeds of Down the River were planted by a small group of experienced river
                    guides and outdoor educators who shared a common dream: to create expeditions
                    that were less about checklist tourism and more about deep, transformative
                    connection with wild waterways.

                    Then, in 2020, the world stopped. The pandemic forced everyone indoors, severing
                    our connection to the rivers we loved. But it was in this forced stillness that
                    our purpose crystallized. We saw a growing, profound hunger for raw, authentic
                    nature, for spaces of freedom and resilience away from crowded places. The name
                    "Down the River" emerged as a metaphor for surrender—to the flow of the current,
                    to the uncertainty of the times, and to the powerful healing journey that only a
                    river can provide.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>In the mid-19th century, businessman Don Martín Ávila purchased a large hacienda in
                the mountains
                north of Caracas. The property contained a stunning natural waterfall that cascaded
                down a cliff
                face from the Ávila Mountain. Captivated by its beauty and entrepreneurial spirit,
                Don Martín had
                the visionary idea to create a resort for the capital's elite.

                Around 1874, he opened "El Salto" (The Waterfall), an ambitious and luxurious
                recreational complex.
                It featured elegant paths, viewing balconies carved into the rock for admiring the
                30-meter fall,
                gardens, and even a small tramway to transport visitors. For decades, it was the
                premier getaway for
                wealthy caraqueños, a symbol of elegance and nature just a short trip from the city.
